# PixelUI
Adds GUIs to the [Pixel](https://github.com/gopxl/pixel) rendering engine by interpreting [imgui-go](https://github.com/inkyblackness/imgui-go) render data into Pixel render calls.

# Example
The [examples](https://github.com/gopxl/pixel-examples/tree/main/ext/pixelui) repository contains an example demonstrating PixelUI's functionality.

To run an example, navigate to it's directory, then go run the test.go file. For example:

```
$ cd example
$ go run test.go
```
